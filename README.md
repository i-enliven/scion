# Gemini Swarm (gswarm)

A container-based orchestration tool for managing concurrent Gemini CLI agents.

## Overview

`gswarm` enables parallel execution of specialized Gemini CLI agents with isolated identities, credentials, and workspaces. It follows a Manager-Worker architecture where the host-side CLI orchestrates the lifecycle of isolated containers acting as independent agents.

## Key Features

- **Parallelism**: Run multiple agents concurrently as independent processes.
- **Isolation**: Strict separation of identities, credentials, and configuration.
- **Context Management**: Dedicated git worktrees for each agent to prevent conflicts.
- **Specialization**: Role-based agent configuration via templates.
- **Interactivity**: Detached background operation with human-in-the-loop "attach" capability.

## Quick Start

### Initialize

```bash
gswarm init
```

### Start an Agent

```bash
gswarm start "Analyze this codebase" --name auditor --type security-auditor
```

### List Agents

```bash
gswarm list
```

### Attach to an Agent

```bash
gswarm attach auditor
```
